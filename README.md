# ðŸš€ action-repo

This is a dummy GitHub repository used to simulate and trigger webhook events such as:

- `push`
- `pull_request`
- `merge` (via pull request merge)

These webhook events are sent to a Flask webhook listener defined in the [webhook-repo](https://github.com/Ansh9728/webhook-repo.git), which processes and stores them in MongoDB.
